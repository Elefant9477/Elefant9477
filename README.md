# Heyo!👋🏻
### 📌 Something about me
<img align="right" alt="Elefant9477" width="300" src="https://github.com/Elefant9477/Elefant9477/blob/main/cereal.gif" />


🍪 I mostly post codes in a specific period (Mid-Autumn to Mid/Late-Winter).

🍳 Other months I cook in Codespaces.

🧮 Usually code in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML and Python.

🧀 I'm not a coder. I'm still on my way to be a full-stack developer so my repositories are all private.
